# EEG Electrodes Mapping
The mapping of the electrodes has been done manually and should be considered an approximation. The author does not verify its accuracy and assumes no responsibility for any potential discrepancies or errors.



Generally, for the high-density EEG caps, electrodes are labelled using an ABC labelling system, which lacks intuitive information regarding the spatial location of each channel on the head. To address this issue and facilitate comprehension, we performed a mapping of the labels to the standard 10/20 labelling system.
The 10/20 system is widely used in electroencephalography (EEG) and provides a systematic way to denote the positions of electrodes relative to cranial landmarks. By mapping our electrode labels to this system, users can easily understand the placement of each electrode on the scalp and relate it to specific brain regions.
